I do so miss your dear kind loving arm so round my neck so much and I miss your soft warm cheek on mine. But we were too happy for it to last long I suppose, but I shall comfort myself with the thoughts of the past, knowing that there are brighter and greater joys to come when we shall be united, not part as we have had to.
