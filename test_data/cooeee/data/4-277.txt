There is a new line starting from Bunbury to the Vasse, a small seaport 32 miles from Bunbury. I went down yesterday and being out of work applied to the contractor for an axe at 1s. 0d. an hour. I am going down again with my kit on Tuesday. The line will last about 9 months and I ought to pull at least 60 pounds off it. I can make plenty of money here, but only by hard 'graft'.
