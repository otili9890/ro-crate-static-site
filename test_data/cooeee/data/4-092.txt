James is now sitting on a box about a yard from me sewing on a button on his breeches. It's a terrible want, the want of a wife. He wants to know if Mary has mind of the time when she used to learn him to knit in the gallery in Ballymaconnell. He says if she had learned him to sew it would have been of more use to him now.
