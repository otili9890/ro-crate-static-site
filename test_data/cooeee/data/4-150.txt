She should have never been out of the asylum. James and I went and got her fixed in a place at 8s. per week with a woman that kept boarders and we have not heard anything of her since. I have written to James to go and try and find where she is as she would soon go through her £5. I had to give her money when she landed and James paid her train up to Melbourne.
