The landlady Miss Reiley is North of Ireland, has lived near Carrickfergus and in Belfast; is about 7 years in Victoria. She is a music teacher as well as keeping boarders; is an old maid or at any rate a bit on the shelf; is rather peculiar looking but is very attentive to the boarders - that's the main thing.
