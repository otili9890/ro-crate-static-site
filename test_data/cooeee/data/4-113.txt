 [...] I see by the paper that Gladstone proposes to raise a loan of £200,000,000 to buy out the landlords. There certainly needs to be something done. People could never pay high rents at the ruling price of produce. What is your opinion at the prospect of Home Rule? The North seems to be as much against it as the rest of Ireland is for it.
