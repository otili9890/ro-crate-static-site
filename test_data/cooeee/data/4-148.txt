 [...] I am now in a position to state that I, in fact we, have no reason to regret coming to Victoria as far as prospects are concerned. I have not the least doubt that we all will get along better than if we had remained at home. Of course there are social disadvantages such as not being near the rest of you and not being able to see you all occasionally.
