[...] things generally, in fact everything, has been very bad during the last winter. The Government is in a bad state financially, hence retrenchment has been the order of the day right and left; this with the Bank failures has affected everybody, directly or indirectly. However I am pleased to say that with all I have been able to keep up my returns. Indeed I shall be very much disappointed if this year is not as good as last, so far it is better.
