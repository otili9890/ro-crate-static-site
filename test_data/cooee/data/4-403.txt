I am at present prospecting for tin some 8 miles from Powalup for a person named Gilbert at a wage of 9s. 0d. per day and all tools found and dynamite. I will stick at it for 6 months if possible. 
I am glad to see the Irish soldiers fought so well and that all our best Generals are Irish. It makes one feel proud to think he hails from the same country. The Australian are, as you say, no doubt useful as scouts, etc but don't take kindly to discipline.
