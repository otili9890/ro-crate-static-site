Had a letter from John yesterday wanting Sarah to take up the grazing area beside the block that I have got. You will be surprised to know that we have got 780 acres. [191] I applied for a block about 3 months ago and got notice to attend on the 23 April at Bairnsdale and I had the good luck to meet John at the Princes Bridge station and he stayed in Bairnsdale till after the court was held and I got it recommended to me. There is a block alongside that John wishes Sarah to take up but I do not know whether she will do so or not.
