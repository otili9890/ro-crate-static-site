I have been a visit to Melbourne to see poor Sam Hanna who is now very ill in consumption indeed too ill to be a long liver. I believe he has been dabbling a good deal in stocks lately. He has made a lot of money. I believe he is worth nearly £1,000 but if he has made money he has ruined his health....
