Sir,
I am called upon to execute a most painful duty. You are charged by the respectable inhabitants of crimes that render you unfit to exercise the supreme authority another moment in this colony; and in that charge all the officers under my command have joined.
I therefore require you, in His Majesty's sacred name, to resign your authority, and to submit to the arrest which I hereby place you under, by the advice of all my officers, and by the advice of every respectable inhabitant in the town of Sydney.
I am, etc.
GEO. JOHNSTON,
Acting Lieu't-Gov. and Major commanding N.S.W. Corps.
To William Bligh, Esq., F.R.S., etc., etc., etc.
