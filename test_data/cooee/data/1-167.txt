Honoured Sir,
With feelings of the most respectful nature, we beg you to accept our most heartfelt acknowledgments for the many comforts and indulgences we have received from you during the passage from England, and for which we are indebted to your kindness and humanity.
Were it possible, honoured Sir, for us to show you in a more striking manner the high sense we entertain for the many kindnesses we have received, we should consider ourselves completely happy; but as that, perhaps, may never occur, we now, with sentiments of the highest esteem for your kindness, return you our most grateful and sincere thanks; and remain,
Honoured Sir,
Your most obedient and very humble servants,
THE CONVICTS.
