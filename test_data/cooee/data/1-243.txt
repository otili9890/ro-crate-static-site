Finding they [i.e. bushrangers] did not avail themselves of my late Proclamation, which expired on the 20th inst., I have ordered an increased number of constables for the present, with Soldiers and aborigines to accompany them, with a reward of £5 for every Bushranger; these, as they are brought in, shall be sent on board the Hulk and removed as necessary to Moreton Bay, which I should recommend as the Second place of punishment, viz. Port Macquarie for first grave offences; Moreton Bay, for runaways from the former, and Norfolk Island, as the ne plus ultra of Convict degradation.
