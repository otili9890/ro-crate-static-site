Dear Sir, - 
Your letter was placed before the meeting of our Union, and we are instructed to thank you for the courtesy which dictated it.
The members of our churches will hail with satisfaction your effort to bring together the people of these colonies, and to strengthen the bonds which already unite us in heart.
We pray that the King of Kings will guide your deliberations for the good of the Australasian peoples.
We are, dear Sir,
Yours faithfully,
