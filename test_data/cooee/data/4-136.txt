Enclosed please find Post Office order of £7 which Hugh sent me to forward to you, payable at the Belfast Post Office same as the last which I hope went all right. I would liked to have made it out £10 but neither John nor I had it to spare. [160] John has not been working on the trams since the second week in January so you see money is not as flush with us as it would have been had it been otherwise. 
John had to give up the time-keeping owing to the hours being long and late. Then he was on the tramcar for a fortnight the time of the holidays which ended his work on the trams until a new line is opened up, which may not take place for another month or so. He is going into town tomorrow to ascertain if there is any new hands wanted. You will be glad to hear that John and I are stopping together since 1st February [...] tell Susanna I will not be able to do anything in the way of collecting money for a bazaar. I need not tell you that collecting money is a thing I don't care for and besides I have little to spare myself. The church that John is in connection with is building a new one so they can do with a subscription from both of us. 
Robbie Hanna was here spending the day with us last Sunday. He told me he had got a book sent by Mrs. Furey. He has been round with Mr. Agnew and Mr. Purse. They gave him £1 each. He has several other pounds.
