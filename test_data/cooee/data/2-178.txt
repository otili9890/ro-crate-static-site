Melbourne. - The town of Melbourne is now half a mile in length, the houses at intervals extending over the whole of that space, the habitations at a rough guess are three hundred and fifty; the population one thousand , including children not under twelve years of age, and for the protection of its inhabitants and their property, there are, I believe, only four constables. [98] How they divide the watches I do not know; but Sure I am that if they were up altogether during the whole of time night they would not be sufficient to guard against the depredations so constantly committed; it is easy for the house breaker to watch them off' their beat and effect his deeds of darkness, as for me to peal and eat a roasted potato.
