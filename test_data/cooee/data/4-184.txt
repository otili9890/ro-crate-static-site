Sarah wishes you to send her the making of a black cashmere dress, buttons and body lining. A very poor black cashmere costs 4s. 6d. or 5s. 0d. There is such heavy duty here now that all the Irish people are sending home for dress goods. [170] Also a white sunshade for Susie to go to church. What she wants is something with a puff in the crown with a ribbon across, either with or without; about what would fit Mary Johnstone. 
Would James send me a black hard hat size 67 / 8 at about 5s. 0d. or 5s.6d., also a soft light grey for the summer. Send with James Colven if he is able to pack them. If not he could bring a small deal box about 18 inches by 24 inches. And she wants a few cheap silk handkerchiefs. Perhaps Mrs. Henry could help him to fetch them. Sarah has not a chance of wholesale prices here. Don't send them by post owing to the duty, only if J. Colven comes. 
PS Please send the account of these things.
