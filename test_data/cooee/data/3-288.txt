I lives in a little wooden hut on the near top of a hill in a nice view of Castlemaine and surrounding country about a mile off from town but I have not many neighbours by me. The miners are my best friends. One of the wives of one is a good tailoress and dressmaker. She makes suits of clothes for them and me.
