Geoff sends his love. He and I are going to try our fortunes up in the North (Derby) among the wild niggers. We start next month sometime after Christmas. We ought each to get £100 per annum up there on one of the stations. You see sheep and cattle with a few horses constitute a station. It is too hot for anything to grow so no actual farming is carried on. The country up there is sparsely settled but a lot of men are wanted on the stations and high wages are given as men are scarce and the gold fields draw them all off so if we can keep steady and save a little there is nothing to stop us having a station of our own eventually; sheep increase so and land only 10s. 0d. per 1,000 acres (lease perpetual) and good feeding land too [...] 
By the way I cut my knee on the edge of the kneecap so badly that although done a month and over I am lame still and I'm in doubts whether I won't always be a bit rickety. I cut one of the sinews badly. It had to be sewn up.
